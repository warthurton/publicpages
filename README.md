# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by pairing with
smart people at [Hashrocket](http://hashrocket.com/).

For a steady stream of TILs from a variety of rocketeers, checkout
[til.hashrocket.com](https://til.hashrocket.com/).

## Usage

To auto-generate the README.md file, you can run
    ./createReadme.py > README.md

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -

The `.vimrc` file for this project contains a function `CountTILs` that can
be invoked with `<leader>c`. This will do a substitution count of the
current number of TILs and display the result in the command tray.

## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
